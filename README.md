# FeatureExtractor

This function creates a csv file with features generated by a forward pass through an ImageNet pre-trained network
for given images.

- `imgs_path`:
   Path where the images are located. (also see multifolder argument to process multiple folders at the same time)
- `output_path`:
   Path where the feature csv file should be saved to.
- `model`:
   Model name (e.g. resnet18). Check files in encoder_models to see what is available.
- `multifolder`:
   Default False. Set if the specified imgs_path contains multiple folders with images, that should all be processed.
- `img_type`:
   Default is "png". Image type to look for.


To install the necessarity packages just run `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
